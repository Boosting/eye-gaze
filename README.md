## Repo for Eye Gaze Detection and Tracking

We have implemented an Eye Gaze tracking system ( currently in Beta version ) using a series of algorithms. It computes the following :

* Pupil detection

* Facial Normal

* Gaze direction

To have a look into how we did it, just clone the repository. Then, 

```
$ cd eye-gaze
$ make
```
For a trial,

```
$ cd eye-gaze
$ ./bin/oic
```
